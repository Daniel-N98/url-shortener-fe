# URL Shortener

The URL Shortener can be used to shorten any links that may be too long to send, or to avoid cluttering a chat. <i>(This project is a concept, and therefore uses a randomly generated domain name which may cause shortened links to actually be longer than the original in some cases, i.e, https://www.google.com/)</i>

This project was created with the following technology:
